<p>We`ve already achieved a lot, we have a kind of manual calculator that can evaluate what a sequence of moves will provide as a final state.</p>
<p>What if we want to automate that calculator:</p>
<ul>
<li>Here&#39;s an initial state</li>
<li>Here&#39;s an array of moves</li>
</ul>
<p>What will that array produce ?</p>
<p>Let&#39;s step back a bit, this is a well-known problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of the ~~ operator, let&#39;s consider the + operator</li>
<li>Instead of an array of moves, let&#39;s consider an array of integers</li>
<li>Let&#39;s use 0 as the initial state</li>
</ul>
<p>Using addition, the numbers, and zero in the same way, the outcome of these operations is the sum of all integers. A more academic name for this is the reduction of an array of integer by the addition operator. It already exists in the standard library.</p>
