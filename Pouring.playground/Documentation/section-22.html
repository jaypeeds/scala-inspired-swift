<p>To resolve the problem, we will start from 3 possible initial moves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fill(0)</li>
<li>Fill(1)</li>
<li>Fill(2)</li>
</ul>
<p>For each of these iniital we will add another move, and build arrays of Move we will define as Paths</p>
<p>The number of Paths grows as more steps are added since several choices are available for each new step.</p>
<p>Then we will partition out solutions from the rest of Paths, the latter will get extended each with a new Move, and the same evaluation is performed again.</p>
<p>As we need to compare moves to avoid repetition it needs to implement the equatable protocol.</p>
<p>Finally, we decide to stop after the first batch of solutions.</p>
