    <h1 id="the-pouring-problem">THE POURING PROBLEM</h1>
<p>Given several glasses of defined capacities, the purpose of the pouring problem is to obtain a certain volume of water which does not match any of the individual glasses. There is a tap from which any quantity of water can be filled, and a sink where glasses can be emptied. Finally, it is possible to pour from one glass into another glass. This playground is inspired by a presentation by Martin Odersky on Coursera in his &quot;Introduction to Functional Programming in Scala&quot;</p>
<p>This presentation is meant for the curious reader with little or no background at all in OS X, Objective-C or iOS. Swift will be used as a generic language like BASIC or Pascal in the past, used to approach some theorical domain of computer science. The same motivation is driving us today, since a whole domain is returning into the spotlights, unkown even from experienced developers, Functional Programming, although as old as FORTRAN, but being born again with such new repersentatives as Java 8, Scala, Clojure, or Swift.</p>
<p>Performances of Xcode and Playground being what they are today, be prepared with patience, the beach ball will be seen often. Just keep cool, after a while the code will stop, show first results and let you browse it.</p>
<h2 id="episode-1">Episode 1</h2>
<p>To resolve this problem, we will start using several particular features of Swift</p>
<ul>
<li>Enums with pattern-matching and value bindings</li>
<li>Protocols which are like Intefaces in other language</li>
<li>User defined operators</li>
<li>Map and reduce</li>
<li>Usage of (n-)tuples, or more simply of pairs.</li>
<li>Usage of a nested (private) function</li>
</ul>
<p>First let&#39;s model the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>We use arrays to describe the glasses, initially all are empty. The capacities are constants throughout the resolution, hence the &quot;let&quot; keyword.</li>
<li>The levels of all the glasses together define a state of the resolution. A state is an array of integers.</li>
<li>We can obtain the initial state by multiplying by zero the capacities to obtain an array of same size filled with zeros. A &quot;mapping&quot; with an anonymous function or &quot;lambda&quot; is used instead of an iteration or an enumeration, to inherit from the size.</li>
</ul>
